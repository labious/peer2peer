We are creating a platform where young people especially schools goers are able deal with social challenges that they face on a day to day basis. The social challenges include: Bullying, Gbv(directly/indirectly), mental health issues(depression, suicide and anxiety), lgbtqi violence, etc.   The platform will provide victims with professional health care as needed. The health care will include but not limited to: Psychological help from the relevant professionals that will be available on the application.  The victim would need to fill in a form/survey that will help the algorithm choose a professional can attend to the victims needs.
